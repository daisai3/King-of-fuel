Please write a solidity program called "King of the fools".

It works like this - You can deposit ether or usdc into a smart contract, as long as it's at least 1.5x more money than the previous person. If you do that, you become "King of the fools", and your money gets sent back to the previous person.

Please write the contract with simple UI(doesn't have to be beautiful), following the highest code standards you would usually follow.

Example:

1. Smart contract is empty
2. First person deposits 1 ETH there, nobody gets anything
3. Second person deposits 1.5 ETH there, the first person receives 1.5 ETH
4. ...
